# real-time-garbage_analysis
Garbage (Wastes of all types like plastic, electronics, wastage floating on water, poisonous gases and space waste
(rockets, dead satellites etc.)) is rising exponentially every year clearly, we need an affective strategy to manage this
waste i.e. waste management. This project “Real – Time Garbage analysis” is an idea to have a Real – Time garbage
statistics at a location selected on the map.

Future Enhancements: Because of MATLAB limitations wanted to re-implement with java, JS. also, have plans to
integrate smart trash cans (with location tracking), computer vision to analyze the garbage floating on surface of oceans.
